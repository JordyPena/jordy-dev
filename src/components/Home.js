              I'm a Front end developer in Dallas, TX. I specialize in
              engineering front-end client solutions using ReactJS with
              responsive web design, and reusable code with seamlessly integrated
              custom-built back-end APIs and databases using Node.js and
              PostgreSQL. I also add focus to automated testing using Jest and
              Mocha, Chai, and Supertest to all my projects.

              I'm an avid fitness and health enthusiast. I'm a naturally upbeat
              and social guy, so you don't have to wait until after my morning
              coffee to chat. I'm a full-time Sales Manager, who brings energy
              and motivation to drive results. In my free time I play with my
              french bulldog named Trunks, I keep my brain active by coding
              daily to constantly grow and be challenged outside of my comfort
              zone. I enjoy cooperating ideas and working together with friends
              and peers.
